[![Build Status](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/actions)This repository holds three packages:

 - [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn/): The
   main parser
 - [acorn-loose](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn-loose/): The
   error-tolerant parser
 - [acorn-walk](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn-walk/): The
   syntax tree walker

To build the content of the repository, run `npm install`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acornjs/acorn.git
cd acorn
npm install
```

## Plugin developments

Acorn is designed to support plugins which can, within reasonable
bounds, redefine the way the parser works. Plugins can add new token
types and new tokenizer contexts (if necessary), and extend methods in
the parser object. This is not a clean, elegant APIâ€”using it requires
an understanding of Acorn's internals, and plugins are likely to break
whenever those internals are significantly changed. But still, it is
_possible_, in this way, to create parsers for JavaScript dialects
without forking all of Acorn. And in principle it is even possible to
combine such plugins, so that if you have, for example, a plugin for
parsing types and a plugin for parsing JSX-style XML literals, you
could load them both and parse code with both JSX tags and types.

A plugin is a function from a parser class to an extended parser
class. Plugins can be used by simply applying them to the `Parser`
class (or a version of that already extended by another plugin). But
because that gets a little awkward, syntactically, when you are using
multiple plugins, the static method `Parser.extend` can be called with
any number of plugin values as arguments to create a `Parser` class
extended by all those plugins. You'll usually want to create such an
extended class only once, and then repeatedly call `parse` on it, to
avoid needlessly confusing the JavaScript engine's optimizer.

```javascript
const {Parser} = require("acorn")
const MyParser = Parser.extend(
  require("acorn-jsx")(),
  require("acorn-bigint")
)
console.log(MyParser.parse("// Some bigint + JSX code"))
```

Plugins override methods in their new parser class to implement
additional functionality. It is recommended for a plugin package to
export its plugin function as its default value or, if it takes
configuration parameters, to export a constructor function that
creates the plugin function.

This is what a trivial plugin, which adds a bit of code to the
`readToken` method, might look like:

```javascript
module.exports = function noisyReadToken(Parser) {
  return class extends Parser {
    readToken(code) {
      console.log("Reading a token!")
      super.readToken(code)
    }
  }
}
```

Acorn is open source software released under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/master/acorn/LICENSE).

You are welcome to
[report bugs](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/issues) or create pull
requests on [github](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn). For questions

[Tern discussion forum](https://discuss.ternjs.net).

## Packages

This repository holds three packages:

 - [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn/): The
   main parser
 - [acorn-loose](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn-loose/): The
   error-tolerant parser
 - [acorn-walk](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn-walk/): The
   syntax tree walker

To build the content of the repository, run `npm install`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acornjs/acorn.git
cd acorn
npm install
```

## Plugin developments

Acorn is designed to support plugins which can, within reasonable
bounds, redefine the way the parser works. Plugins can add new token
types and new tokenizer contexts (if necessary), and extend methods in
the parser object. This is not a clean, elegant APIâ€”using it requires
an understanding of Acorn's internals, and plugins are likely to break
whenever those internals are significantly changed. But still, it is
_possible_, in this way, to create parsers for JavaScript dialects
without forking all of Acorn. And in principle it is even possible to
combine such plugins, so that if you have, for example, a plugin for
parsing types and a plugin for parsing JSX-style XML literals, you
could load them both and parse code with both JSX tags and types.

A plugin is a function from a parser class to an extended parser
class. Plugins can be used by simply applying them to the `Parser`
class (or a version of that already extended by another plugin). But
because that gets a little awkward, syntactically, when you are using
multiple plugins, the static method `Parser.extend` can be called with
any number of plugin values as arguments to create a `Parser` class
extended by all those plugins. You'll usually want to create such an
extended class only once, and then repeatedly call `parse` on it, to
avoid needlessly confusing the JavaScript engine's optimizer.

```javascript
const {Parser} = require("acorn")

const MyParser = Parser.extend(
  require("acorn-jsx")(),
  require("acorn-bigint")
)
console.log(MyParser.parse("// Some bigint + JSX code"))
```

Plugins override methods in their new parser class to implement
additional functionality. It is recommended for a plugin package to
export its plugin function as its default value or, if it takes
configuration parameters, to export a constructor function that
creates the plugin function.

This is what a trivial plugin, which adds a bit of code to the
`readToken` method, might look like:

```javascript
module.exports = function noisyReadToken(Parser) {
  return class extends Parser {
    readToken(code) {
      console.log("Reading a token!")
      super.readToken(code)
    }
  }
}
```
